	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the feasibility and clinical utility of using passive electrocorticography (ECoG) for online spatial-temporal functional mapping (STFM) of language cortex in patients being monitored for epilepsy surgery.
Methods: We developed and tested an online system that exploits ECoG's temporal resolution to display the evolution of statistically significant high gamma (70â€“110 Hz) responses across all recording sites activated by a discrete cognitive task. We illustrate how this spatial-temporal evolution can be used to study the function of individual recording sites engaged during different language tasks, and how this approach can be particularly useful for mapping eloquent cortex.
Results: Using electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) as the clinical gold standard for localizing language cortex, the average sensitivity and specificity of online STFM across 7 patients were 69.9\% and 83.5\%, respectively. Moreover, relative to regions of interest where discrete cortical lesions have most reliably caused language impairments in the literature, the sensitivity of STFM was significantly greater than that of ESM, while its specificity was also greater than that of ESM, though not significantly so.
Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility and clinical utility of online STFM for mapping human language function, particularly under clinical circumstances in which time is limited and comprehensive ESM is impractical.},

	abstract = {The localization of cortical sites essential for language was assessed by stimulation mapping in the left, dominant hemispheres of 117 patients. Sites were related to language when stimulation at a current below the threshold for afterdischarge evoked repeated statistically significant errors in object naming. The language center was highly localized in many patients to form several mosaics of 1 to 2 sq cm, usually one in the frontal and one or more in the temporoparietal lobe. The area of individual mosaics, and the total area related to language was usually much smaller than the traditional Broca-Wernicke areas. There was substantial individual variability in the exact location of language function, some of which correlated with the patient's sex and verbal intelligence. These features were present for patients as young as 4 years and as old as 80 years, and for those with lesions acquired in early life or adulthood. These findings indicate a need for revision of the classical model of language localization. The combination of discrete localization in individual patients but substantial individual variability between patients also has major clinical implications for cortical resections of the dominant hemisphere, for it means that language cannot be reliably localized on anatomic criteria alone. A maximal resection with minimal risk of postoperative aphasia requires individual localization of language with a technique like stimulation mapping.},

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range have been reported in many cortical areas, but the role they play in cortical processing remains unclear. We tested a recently proposed hypothesis that the intensity of sensory input is coded in the timing of action potentials relative to the phase of gamma oscillations, thus converting amplitude information to a temporal code. We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex in awake monkeys while presenting a vibratory stimulus at different amplitudes. We developed a novel technique based on matching pursuit to study the interaction between the highly transient gamma oscillations and spikes with high time-frequency resolution. We found that spikes were weakly coupled to LFP oscillations in the gamma frequency range (40-80 Hz), and strongly coupled to oscillations in higher gamma frequencies. However, the phase relationship of neither low-gamma nor high-gamma oscillations changed with stimulus intensity, even with a 10-fold increase. We conclude that, in SII, gamma oscillations are synchronized with spikes, but their phase does not vary with stimulus intensity. Furthermore, high-gamma oscillations ({\textgreater}60 Hz) appear to be closely linked to the occurrence of action potentials, suggesting that LFP high-gamma power could be a sensitive index of the population firing rate near the microelectrode.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the relation between the spiking of individual neurons and the aggregate electrical activity of neuronal ensembles as seen in local field potentials (LFPs). Because LFPs reflect both spiking activity and subthreshold events, this question is not simply one of data aggregation. Recording from 20 neurosurgical patients, we directly examined the relation between LFPs and neuronal spiking. Examining 2030 neurons in widespread brain regions, we found that firing rates were positively correlated with broadband (2-150 Hz) shifts in the LFP power spectrum. In contrast, narrowband oscillations correlated both positively and negatively with firing rates at different recording sites. Broadband power shifts were a more reliable predictor of neuronal spiking than narrowband power shifts. These findings suggest that broadband LFP power provides valuable information concerning neuronal activity beyond that contained in narrowband oscillations.},

	url = {C:\Documents and Settings\sinai\My Documents\research\literature\Blume2004ecs_Adischarge.pdf},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether certain aspects of after-discharges (ADs) obtained during cortical functional mapping provide better correlations between stimulus site and that of spontaneous seizures. Secondly, we wished to determine the percentage of stimulations evoking ADs and, of these, the percentage which clearly involves more than one electrode position, potentially inaccurately localizing cortical function. Thirdly, we wished to quantify the incidences of the several AD morphologies described by Jasper [in: Epilepsy and the functional anatomy of the human brain, 1954, p. 183; p. 692] and to assess whether certain morphologies had a greater tendency to evolve in frequency or morphology. METHODS: In these 29 patients requiring invasive recordings to determine principal epileptogenic areas, only subdural strips were placed in 19 patients, only grids in 2 patients, and both in 8 patients. A median of 21 electrodes per patient was stimulated of a median of 63 electrodes placed, with the following parameters: biphasic, monopolar, 50 Hz, 0.3 ms pulse duration, 1.5-18 mA. Coverage involved the frontal and parietal lobes (9 patients), frontal parietal temporal lobes (8), frontal temporal (3), temporal (2), occipital (2) and occipital temporal (2) with other combinations in 3 additional patients. Classification of AD morphologies was determined by a pilot study using IFSECN definitions [Electroenceph clin Neurophysiol 1974;37:538] and descriptions by Jasper [in: Epilepsy and the functional anatomy of the human brain, 1954, p. 183] and Gloor [in: Advances in neurology, vol. 8, 1975; p. 59]. RESULTS: Four hundred and two ADs (12\%) were elicited by 3358 trains of electrical stimuli of which 260 (65\%) clearly involved more than only the stimulated electrode position. Thus, 260 (8\%) of 3358 stimulations evoked an AD that could mislocalize cortical function. The proportion of stimulating electrodes eliciting ADs ranged among patients from 4 to 83\% (median 33\%). Polyspike bursts and sequential spikes were the most common AD morphologies. Ten percent of ADs evolved in morphology, frequency or both. Evolution occurred more commonly (44\%) with rhythmic waves than with other AD morphologies (7\%). Neither evolving ADs, ADs producing clinical seizures, or ADs exceeding 10 s correlated topologically with spontaneous seizure origins. CONCLUSIONS: Although occurring in a minority of cortical electrical stimuli, ADs may involve more than the stimulus site and therefore may inaccurately localize cortical function. Our material failed to disclose any consistent relationship between the site of stimulus eliciting ADs and that of spontaneously appearing seizures, even when certain aspects of such ADs were analysed. SIGNIFICANCE: These data illustrate the need for scrutiny of the post-stimulus electrocorticogram for ADs and particularly those involving extra stimulus sites. Whether varying the stimulus parameters prospectively will disclose a better seizure localizing value for ADs remains to be determined.},

Nevertheless, ESM for language mapping has likely minimized postoperative language decline in numerous patients, and has generated a wealth of data elucidating brain-language relations. This article reviews the literature on topographical patterns of language organization inferred from ESM, and the influence of patient characteristics on these patterns, including baseline ability level, age, gender, pathology, degree of language lateralization and bilingualism. Questions regarding clinical validity and limitations of ESM are discussed. Finally, recommendations for clinical practice are presented, and theoretical questions regarding ESM and the findings it has generated are considered.},

Further progress and realization of practical applications depends on systematic evaluations and comparisons of different brain signals, recording methods, processing algorithms, output formats, and operating protocols. However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BCI2000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.},

BCIs are communication systems that enable users to send commands to computers solely by means of brain activity. BCIs are gaining interest among the virtual reality (VR) community since they have appeared as promising interaction devices for virtual environments (VEs). The key features of the platform are (1) high modularity, (2) embedded tools for visualization and feedback based on VR and 3D displays, (3) BCI design made available to non-programmers thanks to visual programming, and (4) various tools offered to the different types of users. The platform features are illustrated in this paper with two entertaining VR applications based on a BCI. In the first one, users can move a virtual ball by imagining hand movements, while in the second one, they can control a virtual spaceship using real or imagined foot movements. Online experiments with these applications together with the evaluation of the platform computational performances showed its suitability for the design of VR applications controlled with a BCI.

This software can be easily used in addition to traditional mapping procedures such as the electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) mapping. The software analyses task-related changes in gamma activity recorded from implanted subdural electrocorticography electrodes using extensions to previously published methods. In this manuscript, we describe the system's architecture and workflow required to obtain a map of the eloquent cortex. We validate the system by comparing our mapping results with those acquired using ECS mapping in two subjects. Our results indicate that cortiQ reliably identifies eloquent cortex much faster (several minutes compared to an hour or more) than ECS mapping.

	abstract = {Objective . Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals contain noise that is common to all channels and noise that is specific to individual channels. Most published ECoG studies use common average reference (CAR) spatial filters to remove common noise, but CAR filters may introduce channel-specific noise into other channels. To address this concern, scientists often remove artifactual channels prior to data analysis. However, removing these channels depends on expert-based labeling and may also discard useful data. Thus, the effects of spatial filtering and artifacts on ECoG signals have been largely unknown. This study aims to quantify these effects and thereby address this gap in knowledge. Approach . In this study, we address these issues by exploring the effects of application of two types of unsupervised spatial filters and three methods of detecting signal artifacts using a large ECoG data set (20 subjects, four task conditions in each subject). Main results . Our results confirm that spatial filtering improves performance, i.e., it reduces ECoG signal variance that is not related to the task. They also show that removing artifactual channels automatically (using quantitatively defined rejection criteria) or manually (using expert opinion) does not increase the total amount of task-related information, but does avoid potential contamination from one or more noisy channels. Finally, applying a novel â€˜median average referenceâ€™ filter does not require the elimination of artifactual channels prior to spatial filtering and still mitigates the influence of channels with channel-specific noise. Thus, it allows the investigator to retain more potentially useful task-related data. Significance . In summary, our results show that appropriately designed spatial filters that account for both common noise and channel-specific noise greatly improve the quality of ECoG signal analyses, and that artifacts in only a single channel can result in profound and undesired effects on all other channels.},

	abstract = {The computer music community has historically pushed the boundaries of technologies for music-making, using and developing cutting-edge computing, communication, and interfaces in a wide variety of creative practices to meet exacting standards of quality. Several separate systems and protocols have been developed to serve this community, such as Max/MSP and Pd for synthesis and teaching, JackTrip for networked audio, MIDI/OSC for communication, as well as Max/MSP and TouchOSC for interface design, to name a few. With the still-nascent Web Audio API standard and related technologies, we are now, more than ever, seeing an increase in these capabilities and their integration in a single ubiquitous platform: the Web browser. In this article, we examine the suitability of the Web browser as a computer music platform in critical aspects of audio synthesis, timing, I/O, and communication. We focus on the new Web Audio API and situate it in the context of associated technologies to understand how well they together can be expected to meet the musical, computational, and development needs of the computer music community. We identify timing and extensibility as two key areas that still need work in order to meet those needs.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the brain's functional organisation has greatly benefited from occasional exploratory sessions during electrophysiological studies, trying various manipulations of an animal's environment to trigger responses in particular neurons. Famous examples of such exploration have unveiled various unexpected response properties, such as those of mirror neurons. This approach, which relies on the possibility to test online the reactivity of precise neural populations has no equivalent so far in humans. The present study proposes and applies a radically novel framework for mapping human brain functions in ecological situations based on a combination of a) exploratory sessions, using real-time electrophysiology to formulate hypotheses about the functional role of precise cortical regions and b) controlled experimental protocols specifically adapted to test these hypotheses. Using this two-stage approach with an epileptic patient candidate for surgery and implanted with intracerebral electrodes, we were able to precisely map high-level auditory functions in the patients' superior temporal lobe. We propose that this procedure constitutes at the least a useful complement of electrical cortical stimulations to map eloquent brain areas in epileptic patients before their surgery, but also a path of discovery for human functional brain mapping.},
